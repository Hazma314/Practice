		<h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
		<p>As of the present moment I am old enough to legally drive a car but have not obtained the proper governemntal papers required to do so. As you can see if I were to continue this we would be here for the next 697 years due to my ability to maximize the number of words avalible to finish a sentence. If I didn't know better I might have thought that I was typing a term paper.</p>
		<h3>Some things I do in my freetime:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Play a variety of games</li>
			<li>Eat</li>
			<li>Sleep</li>
			<li>Breathe</li>
			<li>Exist</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Things that I'm going to type here and nobody will care:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fortnite gay</li>
			<li>Apple=sin</li>
			<li>Google=sin</li>
			<li>Basically all options for phones=sin due to them being government tracking devices</li>
			<li>Build the wall</li>
			<li>Greentext is fun</li>
		</ul>
